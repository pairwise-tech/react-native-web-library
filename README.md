# Pairwise React Native Web Library

A bundled version of `react-native-web` ready to roll in the Pairwise Workspace. ðŸ‘·ðŸ“± 

```sh
# Install everything
$ yarn install

# Build it up
$ yarn build

# Serve it up
# yarn serve
```

The build output in `dist/bundle.js` is copied into the Pairwise Workspace client application and served to the app for React Native challenges. Cool!
